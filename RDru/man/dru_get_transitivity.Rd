\title{Return the global transitivity value for a collection of addresses.}
\usage{
dru_get_transitivity(connection, start, end)
}
\arguments{

\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} including columns:
\itemize{
\item address
\item transitivity
}
}
\description{
The function sends a request to a Dru instance
and returns the value of transitivity for addresses in a created graph.
}
\details{
Returns the nodesâ€™ clustering coefficient in the graph. \cr
The graph is created from the blocks in the range:start - end. \cr
For the global clustering coefficient value,
